# Ball-types-Classification-Using-CNN-and-Random-Forest
Ball Type Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Algorithm and Random Forest Algorithm with Local Binary Pattern (LBP) Feature Extraction

Project assignments of Digital Image Processing Course

ðŸ“Œ Used dataset images of balls from the internet and created a model to classify it into 3 classes(Billiard Ball, Soccer, Tennis Ball). 

ðŸ“Œ Utilized deep learning techniques to implement a CNN to build a model classification and compared them with models built with the Random Forest algorithm 

ðŸ“Œ Improved methodologies using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) feature extraction to improve model performance.
